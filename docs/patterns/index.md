# Engineering Patterns

A collection of engineering patterns and best practices I've learned from building production systems.

## Infrastructure

- [GitOps Patterns](gitops.md) - Declarative infrastructure management with Git as source of truth
- [Terraform Module Design](terraform-modules.md) - Building reusable, composable infrastructure modules

## Observability

- [Observability Strategy](observability.md) - Metrics, logging, and tracing for distributed systems

## AI Engineering

- [Agent Architectures](agent-architectures.md) - Design patterns for AI agents and multi-agent systems
