# Traefik

[Traefik](https://traefik.io/traefik/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/traefik/traefik)) is a cloud-native reverse proxy and ingress controller designed for dynamic service discovery in container orchestrators. Unlike Nginx Ingress which relies on annotation-heavy Ingress resources and periodic config reloads, Traefik watches the Kubernetes API directly and reconfigures routing in real-time as services appear or disappear — no HUP signals, no config generation, no race conditions between discovery and routing.

What distinguishes Traefik from other ingress controllers in this space: it defines routing through IngressRoute CRDs rather than annotations, making routing rules first-class Kubernetes objects that are composable, version-controlled, and reconcilable by GitOps controllers. Middleware (auth, rate limiting, header manipulation) is declared as separate CRD objects and chained declaratively — a model closer to a service mesh's traffic policy than a traditional reverse proxy's monolithic config.

Traefik also natively supports the emerging Gateway API standard, providing an incremental migration path away from its proprietary CRDs when the ecosystem matures.

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| **Namespace** | `traefik` |
| **Type** | HelmRelease (chart: `traefik` v32.1.1) |
| **Layer** | Foundation services |
| **Chart** | [`traefik`](https://helm.traefik.io/traefik) v32.1.1 |
| **Status** | Enabled |
| **Source** | [`apps/base/traefik/`](https://github.com/JiwooL0920/flux-infra/tree/develop/apps/base/traefik/) |

## Dependencies

### Upstream — required before Traefik starts

_No upstream Flux dependencies — starts immediately._

### Downstream — services that depend on Traefik

| Service | Dependency type | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `traefik-config` | Flux `dependsOn` | Requires Traefik |
| `kagent` | Flux `dependsOn` | Requires Traefik |
| `agentgateway` | Flux `dependsOn` | Requires Traefik |

## Purpose

Traefik is the platform's sole ingress controller, routing external traffic to 15+ services across multiple namespaces via `.local` domains. It sits in the foundation layer with zero dependencies — starting immediately on cluster bootstrap — and serves as a prerequisite for `traefik-config` (which declares the IngressRoute/Middleware CRDs), `kagent`, and `agentgateway`.

In this platform it operates as a NodePort service bound to fixed ports on the Kind cluster nodes, allowing the host machine to reach any routed service through a single stable entrypoint without LoadBalancer infrastructure. All routing decisions are expressed as IngressRoute CRDs managed through the same GitOps pipeline as the services themselves.

**Why Traefik over Nginx Ingress or Envoy:** The platform routes to services spanning many namespaces with per-service middleware chains (authentication, CORS, path stripping). Nginx Ingress encodes this in annotations — which are untyped, unvalidatable, and don't compose across objects. Traefik's IngressRoute CRDs make each routing rule and middleware a discrete, reconcilable Kubernetes resource that Flux can manage, diff, and prune like any other manifest. Cross-namespace routing is first-class (`allowCrossNamespace: true`) rather than requiring explicit namespace grants. The built-in dashboard provides immediate routing visibility during development without deploying a separate observability tool. Envoy (via Istio or standalone) would deliver equivalent L7 capability but at 10x the operational complexity and resource cost for a local development cluster.


## Features

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Cross-namespace CRD routing** | kubernetesCRD with allowCrossNamespace enables a single Traefik instance to route to services in any namespace without per-namespace ingress controllers or explicit grants |
| **Dual provider mode** | Both IngressRoute CRDs and standard Ingress resources are served simultaneously, allowing gradual migration and third-party chart compatibility |
| **Pod anti-affinity (HA)** | requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution on hostname topology ensures replicas never co-locate on the same node, eliminating single-node failure as a traffic black hole |
| **JSON access logs with header redaction** | Structured JSON access logs keep general fields but explicitly redact Authorization, Cookie, and Proxy-Authorization headers — queryable without leaking credentials into log aggregation |
| **NodePort fixed-port binding** | Ports 30080 and 30443 are statically assigned for Kind cluster compatibility, giving the host machine deterministic ingress endpoints without cloud LoadBalancer provisioning |
| **Secure dashboard** | Dashboard enabled with insecure mode explicitly disabled — accessible only through authenticated IngressRoute rather than an open internal port |
| **Telemetry suppression** | Version check and anonymous usage reporting disabled via globalArguments, preventing unexpected outbound traffic from the cluster and eliminating startup latency from DNS resolution to Traefik's telemetry endpoints |
| **Health ping endpoint** | Dedicated ping endpoint enabled for liveness/readiness probes and Flux healthCheck verification independent of traffic-serving ports |

## Operations

### Pod stuck Pending due to anti-affinity conflict

**Symptoms:** Traefik pod remains in `Pending` state. `kubectl describe pod` shows: `0/N nodes are available: N node(s) didn't match pod anti-affinity rules` This occurs when replica count exceeds available nodes (common in single-node Kind).

```bash
kubectl get pods -n traefik -l app.kubernetes.io/name=traefik
kubectl describe pod -n traefik -l app.kubernetes.io/name=traefik | grep -A5 Events
kubectl get nodes -o wide
# If single-node cluster: reduce replica count in cluster-vars ConfigMap or temporarily patch anti-affinity
kubectl get configmap cluster-vars -n flux-system -o yaml | grep TRAEFIK_REPLICA_COUNT
# For Kind (single node), set TRAEFIK_REPLICA_COUNT=1 in cluster-vars and reconcile
flux reconcile kustomization traefik --with-source -n flux-system
```

---

### HelmRelease reconciliation failed

**Symptoms:** `flux get helmreleases -n flux-system` shows traefik with `Ready=False`. Typical messages: `Helm upgrade failed: ...`, `values don't meet the specifications`, or chart version not found in repository.

```bash
flux get helmreleases -n flux-system | grep traefik
kubectl describe helmrelease traefik -n flux-system | tail -30
kubectl get helmrepository traefik -n flux-system -o yaml | grep -A5 status
# Verify chart version exists in upstream repo
helm repo add traefik-upstream https://helm.traefik.io/traefik && helm search repo traefik-upstream/traefik --versions | head -10
# Check variable substitution resolved correctly
kubectl get configmap cluster-vars -n flux-system -o yaml | grep TRAEFIK
# Force reconciliation after fixing
flux reconcile helmrelease traefik -n flux-system
```

---

### IngressRoutes not routing traffic (cross-namespace)

**Symptoms:** HTTP requests return 404 despite IngressRoute existing. `kubectl get ingressroute -A` shows the route is created but Traefik dashboard shows no corresponding router entry.

```bash
kubectl get ingressroute -A
# Verify Traefik is watching the target namespace (CRD provider)
kubectl logs -n traefik -l app.kubernetes.io/name=traefik --tail=50 | grep -i 'error\|warn\|skip'
# Check if IngressRoute references a service in another namespace correctly
kubectl get ingressroute <route-name> -n <route-namespace> -o yaml | grep -A3 services
# Verify the backend service and port exist
kubectl get svc -A | grep <backend-service>
# Check Traefik RBAC can read IngressRoutes across namespaces
kubectl get clusterrole -l app.kubernetes.io/name=traefik -o yaml | grep -A5 ingressroute
```
**See also:** docs/adr/009-traefik-ingress.md

### NodePort unreachable from host on Kind

**Symptoms:** `curl localhost:30080` returns connection refused despite Traefik pods running and ready. Service shows correct NodePort allocation in `kubectl get svc -n traefik`.

```bash
kubectl get svc -n traefik -o wide
kubectl get pods -n traefik -o wide
# Verify Kind cluster has port mappings configured (kind-config extraPortMappings)
docker ps --format '{{.Names}} {{.Ports}}' | grep kind
# Check if container port matches NodePort expectations
docker port $(docker ps -q --filter name=kind-control-plane) | grep 30080
# If no port mapping exists, the Kind config needs extraPortMappings for 30080 and 30443
# Test connectivity from inside the cluster
kubectl run curl-test --rm -i --restart=Never --image=curlimages/curl -- curl -s http://traefik.traefik.svc:8000
```

---

### Traefik CrashLoopBackOff on startup

**Symptoms:** Pod repeatedly crashes with `CrashLoopBackOff`. Logs show entrypoint binding errors like `listen tcp :8000: bind: address already in use` or invalid flag errors after chart upgrade.

```bash
kubectl logs -n traefik -l app.kubernetes.io/name=traefik --previous --tail=100
# Check for duplicate entrypoint definitions (additionalArguments conflicting with ports config)
kubectl get helmrelease traefik -n flux-system -o jsonpath='{.spec.values.additionalArguments}'
kubectl get helmrelease traefik -n flux-system -o jsonpath='{.spec.values.ports}'
# Look for port conflicts with other pods on the same node
kubectl get pods -A -o wide | grep $(kubectl get pod -n traefik -l app.kubernetes.io/name=traefik -o jsonpath='{.items[0].spec.nodeName}')
# If flag errors after chart upgrade, check chart changelog for removed/renamed arguments
helm show values traefik/traefik --version $(kubectl get helmrelease traefik -n flux-system -o jsonpath='{.spec.chart.spec.version}') | head -50
```

---

### Flux health check timeout for Traefik Kustomization

**Symptoms:** `flux get kustomizations -n flux-system` shows traefik with `Ready=False` and message `Health check failed after 3m0s: Deployment/traefik/traefik not ready`.

```bash
flux get kustomizations -n flux-system | grep traefik
kubectl get deployment traefik -n traefik -o wide
kubectl rollout status deployment/traefik -n traefik --timeout=30s
kubectl get events -n traefik --sort-by=.lastTimestamp | tail -20
# Check if HelmRelease is stuck (Kustomization waits for deployment, which waits for HelmRelease)
flux get helmreleases -n flux-system | grep traefik
# If deployment exists but replicas not ready, check pod-level issues
kubectl describe deployment traefik -n traefik | grep -A10 Conditions
kubectl get pods -n traefik -l app.kubernetes.io/name=traefik -o yaml | grep -A5 containerStatuses
```
