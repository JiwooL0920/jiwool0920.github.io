# Welcome

I'm Jiwoo Lee, an infrastructure and AI engineer. This site documents my projects and engineering patterns I've learned along the way.

## Projects

I maintain several infrastructure and AI projects:

| Project | Description | Stack |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| [Fleet Infrastructure](projects/fleet-infra/index.md) | Kubernetes GitOps infrastructure | FluxCD, Kustomize |
| [Terraform Infrastructure](projects/terraform-infra/index.md) | Modular cloud infrastructure | Terraform, AWS/GCP |
| [Grafana Dashboards](projects/grafana-dashboards/index.md) | Observability dashboards | Grafana, Prometheus |
| [Agentic AI](projects/agentic-ai/index.md) | AI agent platform with RAG | Python, LangChain |

## Engineering Patterns

Documented patterns and learnings from building production systems:

- [GitOps Patterns](patterns/gitops.md) - Declarative infrastructure management
- [Terraform Module Design](patterns/terraform-modules.md) - Reusable infrastructure components
- [Observability](patterns/observability.md) - Metrics, logging, and tracing strategies
- [Agent Architectures](patterns/agent-architectures.md) - AI agent design patterns
